                  <h2>The first memorandum provides</h2>
                  <p>Recently, the Department of Defense released two updated memorandums in an effort to increase
                        safety against COVID-19. The memorandums are titled “Tools to Mitigate the Threat of the Omicron
                        Variant of Coronavirus Disease 2019 in the Department of Defense” and “Updated Force Health
                        Protection Guidance (Supplement 15) Revision 3 - Department of Defense Guidance for Coronavirus
                        Disease 2019 Laboratory Testing Services.”</p>

                  <h2>Health Protection Guidance</h2>
                  <p>Per the memo, installation commanders should be prepared to rapidly increase Health Protection
                        Condition (HPCON) levels if Omicron case counts rise. The HPCON framework attachment provides a
                        mechanism by which to increase or decrease the use of non-pharmaceutical measures, such as
                        physical distancing, depending on local surrounding community case counts.</p>
